# Dither-Image
Java program that reduces the number of bits needed from 24 bits to a number between 0 and 8 bits.

The distribution of the bits needed for the pixels must be variable and could be between 0 and 8 bits.
In your developed GUI for producing the dithered image, a specialized field must be used to enable the user to distribute the bits for the three colors Red, Green and Blue as shown in the next figure.

The sum of the entered values could be values between 0 and 8 for the three colors together. For example, Red=2, Green=0 and Blue 1 etc.
